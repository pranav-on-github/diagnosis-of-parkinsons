# Diagnosis-of-Parkinsons
Use SVM to build and train a model using human symptoms record, and classify cells to whether the symptoms shows Parkinson's Positive or Negative 

# Abstract :
Parkinson’s disease is a progressive nervous disorder that 
Affects movement leading to shaking, stiffness, and difficulty
With walking, balance, and coordination.
Parkinson’s symptoms usually begin gradually and get worse 
over time. Parkinson’s disease usually affects the 
People who are above 50 years of age.
There are also certain cases in which the people with below 
age 50 also gets affect by Parkinson’s. this particular case is 
called Young-onset Parkinson’s or (YOPD).
In our model, a huge amount of
 Dataset Is collected from the website called Kaggle which 
 Which contains the symptoms of an Normal people and an
People affected by Parkinson’s disease along with Various 
Parameters. These data is trained using an machine learning
Algorithm (or) model (or) Technique called 
SVM (Support Vector Machine) Classifier. Basically, it is 
An supervised algorithm which comes under the classification 
Techniques.
